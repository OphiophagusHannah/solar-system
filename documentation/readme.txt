Solar System Data

--sizes/movements/features/temperatures/distances (main points to express information)
--steps in 'story' (simple storyboard and sketches of graphics)
--find general style of graphics + color choise
--try different kinds of data vizualization (figure out transitions between)

Proposal:
This project will be focused on visual representation of simple data. Its purposes are to explore different data visualization graphics for showing different relationships, organize infographics within one particular style, as well as gain more knowledge about D3 framework and SVG graphics. Data set will represent information about mostly solar system and all infographics will be placed in step by step story, which also can be organized as a slider. Most of the graphics will be interactive with the use of transition between organization of graphics and text.

Notes. because of this project contains multiple infographics, some of them can be excluded or included due to time limits. it will not influence general structure of the story, but will allow to work step by step.

- Outline
(create step by step story)
1.
Begin with general data space:
-use bandle layout to show proportions
-use tree layout to show structure and dependancy
-reorganize data with transition between graphs
2. 
Go to the solar system:
-use animated circular force diagram that will show basic rotation speed, radiuses, distances from the sun and between planets and their moons.
-on hover over the specific planet tooltip will appear and color of figures and lines will be changed for representing info and connections/dependancy
3.
Transfer to linear representation.
-create multiple change modes such as: 
	- in order
	- by size 
	- by distance
	- by density (try to work with opacity)
	- by average mooving speed
4.
Zoom in planet on click
-show its moons
-show anual and dayly changes using histogram in circle
5. 
Show chord diagram of elements.
6.
Show histogram of element on each planet.
-reorganize planets by:
	- radius
	- distance from sun
	- amount of the element
-show elements organized vertically by weight
7.
Reorganize planets vertically by gravity
-show elements organized vertically by weight
-on hover over planet, connect with existed there elements with lines.

Opportunity to skip the story.
Opportynity to go back to frame.

Style:
Use primarily circles and triangles.
Color-code.
